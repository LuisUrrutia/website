A good Git workflow can make or break team productivity. Here's what works.

## Conventional Commits

Use structured commit messages for better history and automated changelogs.

```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login redirect issue
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify user validation logic
```

## Branch Naming

Consistent branch names make navigation easier.

```
feature/user-authentication
fix/login-redirect
chore/update-dependencies
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Keep PRs small and focused
2. Write descriptive titles and descriptions
3. Request reviews from relevant team members
4. Address feedback promptly

## Rebase vs Merge

I prefer rebasing feature branches to keep history linear, but merge commits for the main branch.

```bash
# Update feature branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Merge to main with merge commit
git merge --no-ff feature/my-feature
```

## Conclusion

Invest time in establishing good Git practices early. Your future self will thank you.
