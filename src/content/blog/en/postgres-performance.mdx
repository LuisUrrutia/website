PostgreSQL is a powerful database, but getting optimal performance requires understanding its internals.

## Indexing Strategies

Proper indexing is the most impactful optimization you can make.

```sql
-- B-tree index for equality and range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Partial index for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_pending ON orders(created_at)
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Composite index for multi-column queries
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, created_at DESC);
```

## Query Analysis with EXPLAIN

Always analyze your queries before optimizing.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE user_id = 123
AND created_at > '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Connection Pooling

Use a connection pooler like PgBouncer for high-throughput applications.

## Vacuum and Analyze

Keep your tables healthy with regular maintenance.

```sql
-- Analyze table statistics
ANALYZE orders;

-- Vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM ANALYZE orders;
```

## Conclusion

Database performance is about understanding your data patterns and applying the right optimizations.
