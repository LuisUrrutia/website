Docker has transformed how we develop and deploy applications. Here's how I use it to streamline my development workflow.

## Why Docker for Development?

The classic "it works on my machine" problem disappears when everyone uses the same containerized environment.

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

## Docker Compose for Multi-Service Apps

Most real applications need multiple services. Docker Compose makes orchestrating them simple.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  db:
    image: postgres:16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
```

## Tips for Faster Builds

1. **Order matters** - Put rarely changing layers first
2. **Use .dockerignore** - Exclude node_modules, .git, etc.
3. **Multi-stage builds** - Keep production images small
4. **Layer caching** - Separate dependency installation from code copy

## Conclusion

Docker eliminates environment inconsistencies and makes onboarding new team members a breeze.
