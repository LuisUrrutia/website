Good API design is crucial for developer experience and system maintainability. Here are principles I follow.

## Consistency is King

Use consistent naming conventions throughout your API. If you use `snake_case` for one endpoint, use it everywhere.

```json
{
	"user_id": "123",
	"created_at": "2026-01-03T10:00:00Z",
	"first_name": "John",
	"last_name": "Doe"
}
```

## Proper HTTP Status Codes

Use status codes semantically:

- **200** - Success
- **201** - Created
- **400** - Bad Request (client error)
- **401** - Unauthorized
- **403** - Forbidden
- **404** - Not Found
- **500** - Server Error

## Pagination Done Right

Always paginate list endpoints. Cursor-based pagination scales better than offset-based.

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6MTAwfQ==",
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

## Versioning Strategy

Version your API from day one. URL versioning is the most explicit approach.

```
GET /api/v1/users
GET /api/v2/users
```

## Conclusion

A well-designed API is a joy to work with and reduces support burden significantly.
