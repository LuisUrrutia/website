Serverless is powerful but has its quirks. Here's what I've learned running Lambda in production.

## Cold Starts Mitigation

Cold starts are real. Minimize them with these strategies.

```typescript
// Keep connections outside the handler
const db = createConnection();

export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayEvent) => {
	// Reuse connection across invocations
	const result = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users");
	return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify(result) };
};
```

## Right-Sizing Memory

More memory means faster CPU. Find the sweet spot.

```yaml
# Start with 256MB and adjust based on metrics
Resources:
  MyFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      MemorySize: 256
      Timeout: 30
```

## Structured Logging

Make debugging easier with structured logs.

```typescript
console.log(
	JSON.stringify({
		level: "info",
		message: "Processing order",
		orderId: event.orderId,
		timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
	}),
);
```

## Conclusion

Serverless requires a different mindset, but the operational benefits are significant.
