In today's fast-paced development landscape, choosing the right tools and architecture patterns can make or break your project. After years of building web applications, I've developed a set of principles and preferences that consistently deliver results.

## The Foundation: TypeScript Everywhere

TypeScript has become non-negotiable in my projects. The type safety it provides catches countless bugs at compile time rather than runtime, and the developer experience improvements are substantial.

```typescript
interface User {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	email: string;
	createdAt: Date;
}

function processUser(user: User): void {
	// TypeScript ensures we're working with the right shape
	console.log(`Processing ${user.name}`);
}
```

## Framework Choice: It Depends

I don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. The framework choice should depend on the project requirements:

- **Astro** for content-heavy sites with minimal interactivity
- **Next.js** for full-stack applications with complex data requirements
- **React** with Vite for SPAs where SEO isn't critical

## Performance as a Feature

Performance isn't an afterthought—it's a core feature. Some practices I follow:

1. **Code splitting** - Only load what's needed
2. **Image optimization** - Use modern formats like WebP and AVIF
3. **Edge caching** - Serve content from locations close to users
4. **Core Web Vitals** - Monitor and optimize LCP, FID, and CLS

## Conclusion

The best technology stack is the one that solves your specific problems efficiently. Stay curious, keep learning, and don't be afraid to question conventional wisdom.
