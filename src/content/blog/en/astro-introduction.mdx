When rebuilding my portfolio, I evaluated many frameworks. Astro stood out for several reasons.

## Zero JavaScript by Default

Astro ships zero JavaScript unless you explicitly need it. This results in incredibly fast page loads.

```astro
---
// This runs at build time
const posts = await getCollection("blog");
---

<ul>
	{posts.map((post) => <li>{post.data.title}</li>)}
</ul>
```

## Island Architecture

Add interactivity only where needed with client directives.

```astro
<!-- Only loads JS for this component -->
<ReactCounter client:visible />

<!-- Static, no JS -->
<StaticHeader />
```

## Content Collections

Type-safe content management built-in.

```typescript
const blogCollection = defineCollection({
	schema: z.object({
		title: z.string(),
		date: z.date(),
		tags: z.array(z.string()),
	}),
});
```

## Performance Results

My Lighthouse scores speak for themselves:

- Performance: 100
- Accessibility: 100
- Best Practices: 100
- SEO: 100

## Conclusion

For content-focused sites, Astro delivers the best developer and user experience.
