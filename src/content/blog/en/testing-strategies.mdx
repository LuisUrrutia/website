Testing is essential, but not all tests are created equal. Here's my approach to effective testing.

## The Testing Trophy

Instead of the traditional testing pyramid, I prefer the testing trophy approach:

1. **Static Analysis** - TypeScript, ESLint
2. **Unit Tests** - Pure functions, utilities
3. **Integration Tests** - Component interactions
4. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows

## Unit Testing with Vitest

Fast, modern testing for JavaScript.

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { formatPrice } from "./utils";

describe("formatPrice", () => {
	it("formats whole numbers", () => {
		expect(formatPrice(100)).toBe("$100.00");
	});

	it("handles decimals", () => {
		expect(formatPrice(99.99)).toBe("$99.99");
	});
});
```

## E2E Testing with Playwright

Test real user scenarios across browsers.

```typescript
test("user can complete checkout", async ({ page }) => {
	await page.goto("/products");
	await page.click('[data-testid="add-to-cart"]');
	await page.click('[data-testid="checkout"]');
	await expect(page.locator(".confirmation")).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Conclusion

Focus your testing efforts where they provide the most value: integration and E2E tests.
