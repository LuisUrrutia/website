Coming from JavaScript, Rust can feel intimidating. Here's what helped me get started.

## Ownership: The Big Concept

Rust's ownership model is unique. Every value has an owner, and there can only be one.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // s1 is now invalid!

    // println!("{}", s1); // This would fail
    println!("{}", s2); // This works
}
```

## The Borrow Checker

You can reference values without taking ownership using borrows.

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("Length of '{}' is {}", s, len);
}
```

## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is more powerful than JavaScript's switch.

```rust
enum Status {
    Active,
    Inactive,
    Pending(String),
}

fn handle_status(status: Status) {
    match status {
        Status::Active => println!("Active"),
        Status::Inactive => println!("Inactive"),
        Status::Pending(reason) => println!("Pending: {}", reason),
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Rust's learning curve is steep but worth it. The compiler becomes your ally.
