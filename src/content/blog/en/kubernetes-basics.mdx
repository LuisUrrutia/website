Kubernetes has become the standard for container orchestration. Here are the fundamentals you need to know.

## Core Concepts

### Pods

The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A pod can contain one or more containers.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: my-app:1.0.0
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

### Deployments

Manage the desired state of your application, including replicas and updates.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: my-app:1.0.0
```

### Services

Expose your pods to the network, providing stable endpoints.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

## Conclusion

Understanding these basics will help you work effectively with Kubernetes in any environment.
